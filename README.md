# GitHub URL Swapper

A simple Firefox extension to flip between a GitHub repo and its GitHub Pages site.

:arrow_right: If you are visiting a GitHub Pages website, clicking the extension will open a new tab with the corresponding GitHub repo.

:arrow_left: If you are visiting a GitHub repo, clicking the extension will open a new tab with the corresponding GitHub Pages website (which may or may not exist).

(Basically, I got sick of my students sending me one type of URL when I was asking for the other, so I made this extension)

I originally made [this extension for Chrome](https://github.com/rahji/ghswapper). This is a port to Firefox.
